This little example project makes use of RXR basic components.

Note that `rxr` is a symlink to the root folder. The project must be served through HTTP, using a tool such as [annyong](https://github.com/remiprev/annyong), thin (`thin -A file -p 9292 start`)â€¦

When using annyong or the thin command above, the project will be running at http://localhost:9292.
