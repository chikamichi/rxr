# RXR

RXR (pronounced "roxor" or r-x-r) is yet another 2D game engine in JavaScript. It's `canvas`-based only.

## Installation & usage

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/chikamichi/rxr.git
```

WIP: there is no standalone .js to install yet. Figure it out by yourself.

## Local development

* sass: `cd example && compass watch css/*.sass`
* coffee: `coffee -w -o src src/coffee` | `cd example && coffee -w -o js js/src`
* server: `cd example && annyong`
