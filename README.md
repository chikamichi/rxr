# W3techcourses.com — Game Development in HTML5 (November 2011)

This repository is at your disposal to host your code. You may clone it locally by running:

    git clone git@hugr.fr:w3c-html5-games

If you'd like to host your code here, please *create a new branch* with your name.

For instance, if your username is "Johm Smith", you'd like to create `john_smith` with the following command:

    git co -b john_smith

This structure would ease inspection of others' code bases, and may allow for per-branch ACL (if ever needed/required).
